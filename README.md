# Webly's Bakery

This is a solution to the Bitdegree Front-end web development course

## Overview
"Here comes the fun part! Mr. and Mrs. Weebly have been running a local bakery called Weebly's Bakery for an odd 25-30 years.

Their nephew made a website for them in 1995 which is not responsive. This is a problem for her since nobody can use her website easily. This means when they navigate their website, users have trouble finding their phone number or location easily. Neither can users see their bakery items because the images are either too big or small.

All in all their website is a mess and needs to be redone. They've hired a professional this time which is you and not their nephew. Your job is to make a responsive website for the Weebly's Bakery."
